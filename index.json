[{"content":"We build systems that lift the capabilities of programmers dealing with the vast complexity of modern software systems. Our systems automate away inessential complexity and automate in desired features — for example, securing programs that use hundreds of software dependencies, bolting distribution onto existing applications, and parallelizing large-scale pipelines built out of multi-language components. We characterize the behavior of the systems we build using real workloads seen in practice, often paired with mathematical models and proofs of key properties of interest.\nNews # Sep'25: Early ideas on LLM guardrails, hybrid scheduling, and verifiable kernel extensions at SOSP'25 workshops!Aug'25: Two NSDI'26 papers on optimization prediction and fault tolerance for opaque distributed systems!Jul'25: Our benchmark suite for the shell received the Best Paper Award at USENIX ATC'25!Jul'25: Our group received a Google ML-and-Systems Junior Faculty Award on Securing Open-Source Software!Jul'25: Evangelos Lamprou joins the group for his PhD!Jun'25: Our paper on the Koala benchmark for the shells was accepted at Usenix ATC'25\u0026mdash;the last one, ever!May'25: Grigoris Ntousakis started his internship at IBM research!Apr'25: Apply to attend the Brown Systems Week 2025!Mar'25: Our paper on semantics-driven static analysis for the shell made it to HotOS'25!Mar'25: Received an Amazon Research Award (ARA) on Automated Reasoning for the Unix/Linux shell!

Student Research # Automating Protections Against Software Supply-Chain Threats Modern software incorporates thousands of dependencies as a means of accelerating development and reducing cost—risking safety and security for both developers and end-users. We have built a series of systems targeting the JavaScript ecosystem—the largest such ecosystem out there—automating the analysis, transformation, and synthesis of JavaScript dependencies across a variety of threat models. Examples: AsiaCCS'23, CCS'21, CCS'21. Automating Acceleration and Scale-out of Software Systems\nLanguage-agnostic programming environments hinder automated parallelization and distribution, often forcing developers that deal with large datasets to manually rewrite programs and their components in languages that support these features. We have built a series of systems that accelerate, parallelize, distribute, and scale out computations fully automatically — while maintaining key correctness and security guarantees. Our systems target widely used environments — e.g., JavaScript, Python, the Shell — and are offered by open-source consortia such as the Linux Foundation. Examples: NSDI'23, OSDI'22, EuroSys'21. Automated Transformation Towards Secure Scalable Computing Paradigms\nRecent trends are pushing developers towards new paradigms of secure and scalable computing—e.g., confidential computing, microservices, serverless computing, and edge computing. Transforming a conventional program to leverage these paradigms is a laborious manual process that can lead to suboptimal performance and in many cases even break the program. We are developing systems that support this kind of decomposition and leveraging special hardware capabilities when these are available in the network. Examples: ARES'22, PLDI'19, ATC'19.\nKeep in Touch # Mailing list\nGithub organization\nDiscord server\nOnboarding (group-internal document)\nPaSh: Discord server\nPaSh: Mailing list\nBrown systems: Mailing list\nCourses # CS1380: Distributed Computer Systems\nCS2952-R: Systems Transforming Systems\nWeekly systems lunch\nOthers at Brown # Clusters: Systems, PLT, SSL\nOrganizations: DSI, CCV\n","date":"6 March 2023","permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":" Software Supply-Chain Security # Modern software incorporates thousands of dependencies as a means of accelerating its development and reducing its cost—at a significant risk to safety and security for both developers and end-users. We have built a series of systems targeting the JavaScript dependency ecosystem—the largest such ecosystem out there—automating the analysis, transformation, and synthesis of dependencies across a variety of threat models.\nPapers: Our PLOS17 paper identifies key security problems with third-party libraries and sketches a solution that leverages program transformations to lower (and lock) the privilege of individual libraries. Our NDSS18 paper proposes automated transformations that use operating-system protection mechanisms to isolate selected libraries. Our FSE21 paper proposes language-based instrumentation techniques applied to the context around each library to offer low-overhead Turing-complete runtime analysis and isolation. One of our CCS21 papers proposes a read-write-execute (RWX) permission model at the library boundary, combined with static and load-time program analysis that automates permission inference — minimizing developer effort to secure these libraries. Our other CCS21 paper uses active learning and regeneration to synthesize vulnerability-free replacement libraries that fall under certain computational domains.\nOur recent systems, presented at AsiaCCS23 and ACSAC22, protect against memory-unsafe native addons, such as JavaScript or Python libraries developed in C/C++, and offer application-level support for privilege separation. And our ICSE23 paper proposes a collection of executable security benchmarks that can be used to evaluate defenses against supply-chain security issues.\nOngoing work: Our current research (1) develops the model behind library recontextualization and its proofs of soundness properties, (2) proposes the combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to address accuracy and compatibility challenges in shielding third-party libraries, and (3) advocates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome the scalability limitations of vulnerability-free library regeneration.\nSoftware \u0026amp; Systems:\nLya is a system for dynamic program analysis and instrumentation at the boundaries of JavaScript libraries. It forms the basis for much of our runtime security work around JavaScript. Mir is a system for static analysis at the boundaries of JavaScript libraries. BinWrap is a system for protecting applications written in high-level, memory-safe languages from the security problems of memory-unsafe libraries.

Unfortunately, this language-agnostic composition hinders automated parallelization and distribution, often forcing developers to manually rewrite shell programs (and their components) in other languages that support these features. We have built several systems that, combined, offer automated parallelization of Unix/Linux shell scripts—along with serious correctness and compatibility guarantees.\nPapers: Our HotOS15 paper identifies the composition problem with today\u0026rsquo;s distributed computing software — that there\u0026rsquo;s no equivalent of an elegant and simple composition in modern distributed environments— and offers a vision for the future. Our EuroSys21 paper describes our PaSh system for parallelizing shell pipelines, and the corresponding ICFP21 paper formalizes the model at the core of PaSh and proves its parallelizing transformations correct. Our HotOS21 paper outlines a vision for the future of the shell, and our HotOS21 panel discusses future avenues for cross-discipline shell-related research.\nOur recent OSDI22 paper tackles POSIX-compliant parallelization in the presence of fully dynamic behavior pervasive in the shell—via just-in-time compilation, intermixing evaluation and optimization of individual expressions. Our NSDI23 paper takes this to the distributed level, by offering automated POSIX-compliant scale-out across multiple computers. And our HotOS23 paper identifies speculative out-of-order shell-script execution as a key challenge — and sketches appropriate containment mechanisms that can be used to delay and reorder side effects.\nOngoing work: Ongoing research (1) develops an out-of-order execution engine for shell scripts, (2) proposes tackles automated generation of critical runtime components, through a combination of active learning and program synthesis, (3) proposes appropriate fault-tolerance support for distributed shell-script execution, and (4) develops appropriate type systems, formal models, and mathematical proofs targeting environments that support the composition of black-box software components.\nSoftware:\nPaSh is an award-winning just-in-time parallelization system that forms the basis for all our shell-related research.
