  - abstract: 'This paper presents FRACTAL, a new system that offers

      fault tolerant distributed shell script execution for unmod-

      ified scripts. FRACTAL first distinguishes recoverable regions

      from side-effectful ones, and augments them with additional

      runtime support aimed at fault recovery. It employs precise de-

      pendency and progress tracking at the subgraph level to offer

      sound and efficient fault recovery. It minimizes the number of

      upstream regions that are re-executed during recovery and en-

      sures exactly-once semantics upon recovery for downstream

      regions. Evaluation on 4- and 30-node clusters indicates aver-

      age fault-free speedups of (1) >9.6×over Bash, a single-node

      shell-interpreter baseline, (2) >5.5×over Hadoop Streaming,

      a MapReduce system that supports language-agnostic third-

      party components, and (3) 17% over DISH, a state-of-the-art

      fault-intolerant shell-script distribution system—all while re-

      covering 7.8–16.4×faster than Hadoop Streaming in cases

      of faults.'

    abstract: 'KOALA is a benchmark suite aimed at performance-oriented

      research targeting the Unix and Linux shell. It combines a

      systematic collection of diverse shell programs collected from

      tasks found out in the wild, various real inputs to these pro-

      grams facilitating small and large deployments, extensive

      analysis and characterization aiding their understanding, and

      additional infrastructure and tooling aimed at usability and

      reproducibility in systems research. The KOALA benchmarks

      perform a variety of common shell tasks; they combine all

      major language features of the POSIX shell; they use a vari-

      ety of POSIX, GNU Coreutils, and third-party components;

      and they operate on inputs of varying size and composition—

      available on both permanent archival storage and scalable

      cloud storage. Applying KOALA to four systems aimed at

      accelerating shell programs offers a broader perspective on

      their trade-offs, generalizes their key results, and contributes

      to a better understanding of these systems.'

  - abstract: Modern applications, written in high-level programming languages, enjoy
      the security benefits of memory and type safety. Unfortunately, even a single
      memory-unsafe library can wreak havoc on the rest of an otherwise safe application,
      nullifying all the security guarantees offered by the high-level language and
      its managed runtime. We perform a study across the Node.js ecosystem to understand
      the use patterns of binary add-ons. Taking the identified trends into account,
      we propose a new hybrid permission model aimed at protecting both a binary add-on
      and its language-specific wrapper. The permission model is applied all around
      a native add-on and is enforced through a hybrid language-binary scheme that
      interposes on accesses to sensitive resources from all parts of the native library.
      We infer the add-on’s permission set automatically over both its binary and
      JavaScript sides, via a set of novel program analyses. Applied to a wide variety
      of native add-ons, we show that our framework, BinWrap, reduces access to sensitive
      resources, defends against real-world exploits, and imposes an overhead that
      ranges between 0.71%–10.4%.

    abstract: 'Shell scripting remains prevalent for automation and data-processing
      tasks, partly due to its dynamic features—e.g., expansion, substitution—and
      language agnosticism—i.e., the ability to combine third-party commands implemented
      in any programming language. Unfortunately, these characteristics hinder automated
      shell-script distribution, often necessary for dealing with large datasets that
      do not fit on a single computer. This paper introduces DiSh, a system that distributes
      the execution of dynamic shell scripts operating on distributed filesystems.
      DiSh is designed as a shim that applies program analyses and transformations
      to leverage distributed computing, while delegating all execution to the underlying
      shell available on each computing node. As a result, DiSh does not require modifications
      to shell scripts and maintains compatibility with existing shells and legacy
      functionality. We evaluate DiSh against several options available to users today:
      (i) Bash, a single-node shell-interpreter baseline, (ii) PaSh, a state-of-the-art
      automated-parallelization system, and (iii) Hadoop Streaming, a MapReduce system
      that supports language-agnostic third-party components. Combined, our results
      demonstrate that DiSh offers significant performance gains, requires no developer
      effort, and handles arbitrary dynamic behaviors pervasive in real-world shell
      scripts.'

    abstract: 'NPM is the largest software ecosystem in the world, offering millions
      of free, reusable packages. In recent years, various security threats to packages
      published on npm have been reported, including vulnerabilities that affect millions
      of users. To continuously improve techniques for detecting vulnerabilities and
      mitigating attacks that exploit them, a reusable benchmark of vulnerabilities
      would be highly desirable. Ideally, such a benchmark should be realistic, come
      with executable exploits, and include fixes of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately,
      there currently is no such benchmark, forcing researchers to repeatedly develop
      their own evaluation datasets and making it difficult to compare techniques
      with each other. This paper presents SecBench.js,, the first comprehensive benchmark
      suite of vulnerabilities and executable exploits for npm. The benchmark comprises
      600 vulnerabilities, which cover the five most common vulnerability classes
      for server-side JavaScript. Each vulnerability comes with a payload that exploits
      the vulnerability and an oracle that validates successful exploitation. SecBench.js,
      enables various applications, of which we explore three in this paper: (i) cross-checking
      SecBench.js, against public security advisories reveals 168 vulnerable versions
      in 19 packages that are mislabeled in the advisories; (ii) applying simple code
      transformations to the exploits in our suite helps identify flawed fixes of
      vulnerabilities; (iii) dynamically analyzing calls to common sink APIs, e.g.,
      exec(), yields a ground truth of code locations for evaluating vulnerability
      detectors. Beyond providing a reusable benchmark to the community, our work
      identified 20 zero-day vulnerabilities, most of which are already acknowledged
      by practitioners.'

  - abstract: 'In serverless computing, applications are composed of stand-alone

      microservices that are invoked and scale up independently. Peer-

      to-peer protocols can be used to enable decentralized communica-

      tion among the services that compose each application. This paper

      presents Themis, a framework for secure service-to-service interac-

      tion targeting these environments and the underlying service mesh

      architectures. Themis builds on a notion of decentralized identity

      management to allow confidential and authenticated service-to-

      service interaction without the need for a centralized certificate

      authority. Themis adopts a layered architecture. Its lower layer

      forms a core communication protocol pair that offers strong se-

      curity guarantees without depending on a centralized point of

      authority. Building on this pair, an upper layer provides a series of

      actions related to communication and identifier management—e.g.,

      store, find, and join. This paper analyzes the security properties

      of Themis’s protocol suite and shows how it provides a decen-

      tralized and flexible communication platform. The evaluation of

      our Themis prototype targeting serverless applications written

      in JavaScript shows that these security benefits come with small

      runtime latency and throughput overheads, and modest startup

      overheads.'

    abstract: 'This paper presents PaSh, a system for parallelizing POSIX

      shell scripts. Given a script, PaSh converts it to a dataflow

      graph, performs a series of semantics-preserving program

      transformations that expose parallelism, and then converts

      the dataflow graph back into a script—one that adds POSIX

      constructs to explicitly guide parallelism coupled with PaSh-

      provided Unix-aware runtime primitives for addressing per-

      formance- and correctness-related issues. A lightweight an-

      notation language allows command developers to express

      key parallelizability properties about their commands. An

      accompanying parallelizability study of POSIX and GNU

      commands—two large and commonly used groups—guides

      the annotation language and optimized aggregator library

      that PaSh uses. PaSh’s extensive evaluation over 44 unmod-

      ified Unix scripts shows significant speedups (0.89–61.1×,

      avg: 6.7×) stemming from the combination of its program

      transformations and runtime primitives.'

    abstract: In this work, we showcase a set of implemented multiplayer games and
      interactive installations based on Fun in Numbers (FinN). FinN allows the quick
      prototyping of applications that utilize input from multiple physical sources
      (sensors and other means of interfacing), by offering a set of programming templates
      and services, such as proximity, localization and synchronization, that hide
      the underlying complexity.
