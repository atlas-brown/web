 abstract = {This paper presents FRACTAL, a new system that offers
fault tolerant distributed shell script execution for unmod-
ified scripts. FRACTAL first distinguishes recoverable regions
from side-effectful ones, and augments them with additional
runtime support aimed at fault recovery. It employs precise de-
pendency and progress tracking at the subgraph level to offer
sound and efficient fault recovery. It minimizes the number of
upstream regions that are re-executed during recovery and en-
sures exactly-once semantics upon recovery for downstream
regions. Evaluation on 4- and 30-node clusters indicates aver-
age fault-free speedups of (1) >9.6×over Bash, a single-node
shell-interpreter baseline, (2) >5.5×over Hadoop Streaming,
a MapReduce system that supports language-agnostic third-
party components, and (3) 17% over DISH, a state-of-the-art
fault-intolerant shell-script distribution system—all while re-
covering 7.8–16.4×faster than Hadoop Streaming in cases
of faults.}

 abstract = {KOALA is a benchmark suite aimed at performance-oriented
research targeting the Unix and Linux shell. It combines a
systematic collection of diverse shell programs collected from
tasks found out in the wild, various real inputs to these pro-
grams facilitating small and large deployments, extensive
analysis and characterization aiding their understanding, and
additional infrastructure and tooling aimed at usability and
reproducibility in systems research. The KOALA benchmarks
perform a variety of common shell tasks; they combine all
major language features of the POSIX shell; they use a vari-
ety of POSIX, GNU Coreutils, and third-party components;
and they operate on inputs of varying size and composition—
available on both permanent archival storage and scalable
cloud storage. Applying KOALA to four systems aimed at
accelerating shell programs offers a broader perspective on
their trade-offs, generalizes their key results, and contributes
to a better understanding of these systems.},

abstract = {Modern applications, written in high-level programming languages, enjoy the security benefits of memory and type safety. Unfortunately, even a single memory-unsafe library can wreak havoc on the rest of an otherwise safe application, nullifying all the security guarantees offered by the high-level language and its managed runtime. We perform a study across the Node.js ecosystem to understand the use patterns of binary add-ons. Taking the identified trends into account, we propose a new hybrid permission model aimed at protecting both a binary add-on and its language-specific wrapper. The permission model is applied all around a native add-on and is enforced through a hybrid language-binary scheme that interposes on accesses to sensitive resources from all parts of the native library. We infer the add-on’s permission set automatically over both its binary and JavaScript sides, via a set of novel program analyses. Applied to a wide variety of native add-ons, we show that our framework, BinWrap, reduces access to sensitive resources, defends against real-world exploits, and imposes an overhead that ranges between 0.71%–10.4%.}

 abstract = {Shell scripting remains prevalent for automation and data-processing tasks, partly due to its dynamic features—e.g., expansion, substitution—and language agnosticism—i.e., the ability to combine third-party commands implemented in any programming language. Unfortunately, these characteristics hinder automated shell-script distribution, often necessary for dealing with large datasets that do not fit on a single computer. This paper introduces DiSh, a system that distributes the execution of dynamic shell scripts operating on distributed filesystems. DiSh is designed as a shim that applies program analyses and transformations to leverage distributed computing, while delegating all execution to the underlying shell available on each computing node. As a result, DiSh does not require modifications to shell scripts and maintains compatibility with existing shells and legacy functionality. We evaluate DiSh against several options available to users today: (i) Bash, a single-node shell-interpreter baseline, (ii) PaSh, a state-of-the-art automated-parallelization system, and (iii) Hadoop Streaming, a MapReduce system that supports language-agnostic third-party components. Combined, our results demonstrate that DiSh offers significant performance gains, requires no developer effort, and handles arbitrary dynamic behaviors pervasive in real-world shell scripts.},

 abstract = {NPM is the largest software ecosystem in the world, offering millions of free, reusable packages. In recent years, various security threats to packages published on npm have been reported, including vulnerabilities that affect millions of users. To continuously improve techniques for detecting vulnerabilities and mitigating attacks that exploit them, a reusable benchmark of vulnerabilities would be highly desirable. Ideally, such a benchmark should be realistic, come with executable exploits, and include fixes of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, there currently is no such benchmark, forcing researchers to repeatedly develop their own evaluation datasets and making it difficult to compare techniques with each other. This paper presents SecBench.js,, the first comprehensive benchmark suite of vulnerabilities and executable exploits for npm. The benchmark comprises 600 vulnerabilities, which cover the five most common vulnerability classes for server-side JavaScript. Each vulnerability comes with a payload that exploits the vulnerability and an oracle that validates successful exploitation. SecBench.js, enables various applications, of which we explore three in this paper: (i) cross-checking SecBench.js, against public security advisories reveals 168 vulnerable versions in 19 packages that are mislabeled in the advisories; (ii) applying simple code transformations to the exploits in our suite helps identify flawed fixes of vulnerabilities; (iii) dynamically analyzing calls to common sink APIs, e.g., exec(), yields a ground truth of code locations for evaluating vulnerability detectors. Beyond providing a reusable benchmark to the community, our work identified 20 zero-day vulnerabilities, most of which are already acknowledged by practitioners.},

 abstract = {In serverless computing, applications are composed of stand-alone
microservices that are invoked and scale up independently. Peer-
to-peer protocols can be used to enable decentralized communica-
tion among the services that compose each application. This paper
presents Themis, a framework for secure service-to-service interac-
tion targeting these environments and the underlying service mesh
architectures. Themis builds on a notion of decentralized identity
management to allow confidential and authenticated service-to-
service interaction without the need for a centralized certificate
authority. Themis adopts a layered architecture. Its lower layer
forms a core communication protocol pair that offers strong se-
curity guarantees without depending on a centralized point of
authority. Building on this pair, an upper layer provides a series of
actions related to communication and identifier management—e.g.,
store, find, and join. This paper analyzes the security properties
of Themis’s protocol suite and shows how it provides a decen-
tralized and flexible communication platform. The evaluation of
our Themis prototype targeting serverless applications written
in JavaScript shows that these security benefits come with small
runtime latency and throughput overheads, and modest startup
overheads.}

shell scripts. Given a script, PaSh converts it to a dataflow
graph, performs a series of semantics-preserving program
transformations that expose parallelism, and then converts
the dataflow graph back into a script—one that adds POSIX
constructs to explicitly guide parallelism coupled with PaSh-
provided Unix-aware runtime primitives for addressing per-
formance- and correctness-related issues. A lightweight an-
notation language allows command developers to express
key parallelizability properties about their commands. An
accompanying parallelizability study of POSIX and GNU
commands—two large and commonly used groups—guides
the annotation language and optimized aggregator library
that PaSh uses. PaSh’s extensive evaluation over 44 unmod-
ified Unix scripts shows significant speedups (0.89–61.1×,
avg: 6.7×) stemming from the combination of its program
transformations and runtime primitives.},
