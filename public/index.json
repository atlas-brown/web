We have built a series of systems targeting the JavaScript dependency ecosystem—the largest such ecosystem out there—automating the analysis, transformation, and synthesis of JavaScript dependencies across a variety of threat models.\nAutomating the Acceleration and Scale-out of Software Systems: Some programming environments, such as the shell, are used pervasively partly due to their simplicity in combining components (commands) written in multiple languages. Unfortunately, this language-agnostic composition hinders automated parallelization and distribution, often forcing developers to manually rewrite shell programs (and their components) in other languages that support these features. We have built a system, PaSh, and several extensions and sibling projects that offer automated acceleration and scale-out in these environments—along with serious correctness and compatibility guarantees.\nAutomated Transformation Towards Secure Scalable Computing Paradigms: Recent trends are pushing developers towards new paradigms of secure and scalable computing—e.g., confidential computing, microservices, serverless computing, and edge computing. Transforming a conventional program to leverage these paradigms is a laborious manual process that can lead to suboptimal performance and in many cases even break the program. We are developing systems supporting this kind of decomposition and leveraging special hardware capabilities when these are available in the network.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/courses/csci1380/","section":"","summary":"Analysis and Transformation in Languages, Applications, and Systems.","title":""},{"content":" Faculty # Nikos Vasilakis [email] [website] Ph.D. Students # Yizheng Xie [email] [website] Oğuzhan Çölkesen [email] [website] Master Students # Zhicheng Huang [email] [website] Undergraduate Students # Anirudh Narsipur [email] [website] Seth Sabar [email] [website] Seong-Heon Jung [email] [website] Julian Dai [email] [website] Christina Stepin [email] [website] Research Affiliates # Nikos Pagonas [email] [website] Grigoris Ntousakis [email] [website] Giorgos Liargkovas [email] [website] ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/courses/csci1380/people/","section":"","summary":"Faculty # Nikos Vasilakis [email] [website] Ph.","title":""},{"content":" Peer-Reviewed Conference Publications # BinWrap: Hybrid Protection Against Native Node.js Add-ons\nGeorge Christou, Grigoris Ntousakis, Eric Lahtinen, Sotiris Ioannidis, Vasileios P.
