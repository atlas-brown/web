## Communication

We'll be using [Edstem discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/36254) for almost all course-related communication. You can mark questions as private or public. Private messages are seen by all course staff, see the [collaboration policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT1W7YGtmrLtpmyEW8MRimmTeZdB0MF7IuiHSAopU722BHMtoAzPua7A-1YEXF2Watj34cx_p3oatA2/pub) for guidelines of how to choose. You can also use [cs1380tas@lists.brown.edu](mailto:cs1380tas@lists.brown.edu) to e-mail the course staff regarding administrative issues. For sensitive issues that you would not like to discuss with the entire course staff, you may email the instructors and head TAs at [cs1380headtas@lists.brown.edu](mailto:cs1380htas@lists.brown.edu).
