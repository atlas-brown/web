How are services like Google, Facebook, and Amazon built? This hands-on, project-oriented course focuses on the issues encountered in building software systems for data at massive scale. By the end of this course, students will be able to build their own distributed search engine — and to deploy and execute it on cloud resources. We will study how these services handle massive datasets and billions of requests per day. We will build infrastructure for big-data collection and analysis, at-scale processing and storage, and information extraction in the cloud and at the edge — including massive, heavily distributed infrastructure like the one used to run these services in production today.
